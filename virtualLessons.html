      <h1>Benefits of Virutal Lessons</h1>
      <div class = "virtual-container">
         <div class = "virtual-item">
            <h2>Conveniece</h2>
            <p>Neither parent nor teacher needs to drive anywhere. It's cheaper for both of us in terms of time and money, and it is the least disruptive to your routine.
            If somebody is sick, lessons can still go on. If it's snowing outside, there's no need to brave the weather. No kids need to wait in the car, and you have one
            less place to go for the sake of your child's extracurriculars. </p>
         </div>
         <div class = "virtual-item">
            <h2>Fostering Independent Learning</h2>
            <p>I cannot manage the student's music for them. I cannot get on a video call for them. They have to learn to be in charge of themselves to successful in lessons.
            This might at first seem like a downside, but it is in fact a valuable life skill. I was homeschooled, so I did a lot of online learning. I probably would not have
            learned to learn as well without being forced to learn without someone looking over my shoulder. I am still always there to answer questions and demonstrate 
            ways to play things, but the student must play themselves. </p>
         </div>
         <div class = "virtual-item">
            <h2>FLexibility</h2>
            <p>Becuase no one needs to travel, scheduling is easy! You can do lessons anytime, anywhere. I've had students bring portable keyboards/guitars on vacation
            and do lessons from there. I am able reschedule people without having it put too much of a dent in anyone's routine. When no one needs to go anywhere, it 
            removes a lot of complexity.</p>
