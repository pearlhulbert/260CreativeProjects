              <p>I am from Sacramento, California. I started taking piano lessons at age 7, then guitar at 11. I picked up the bass, ukulele, organ, and a little bit of banjo
              along the way. I was in lessons until my sophomore year of high school, when I took the exit exam
              and started college at Folsom Lake College. Currently, I am a junior studying computer science at BYU. I started teaching lessons my freshman year of high schoo.
              I have been so blessed to work with amazing families who have supported me in my teaching journey!</p>

              <p>I am Certificate of Merit Level 6. I have performed at various events, including recitals hosted by my teachers, as an accompanist for local community choirs,
              and for church events and worship services. The image shown is of me playing bass at a church dance in high school.I have loved being able to use the skills
              I have acquired to uplift those around me, and my goal is for my students to be able to do the same. </p>
